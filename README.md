**Boring Segoe UI default font? Try Inter on your browser!**

With this Tampermonkey extension, you can use Inter instead of Segoe UI and system-ui

---
## How does its work?
- It will just change "system-ui" and "Segoe UI" fonts into beatiful apple-like font called "Inter"!

## Why?
- The default Segoe UI font is boring! And I wanted to use the Apple's San Francisco font, but i found that Inter looks same! I imported the Inter code from Google Fonts. Write a _small_ code and it is ready to use!

## Setting up..
There are two options to start:
> NOTE: You need to install "Tampermonkey" extension to start!
### No 1: Copy Paste!
- First, copy the `script.js` file
- Then, go to the TamperMonkey extension's Control Panel menu.
- Click to plus icon
- Paste the code!

### No 2: Detection!
- Click to Tampermonkey extension icon
- Click to "Find new scripts" option in the menu
- It will find the script and you are ready!
